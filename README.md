# GPTSwift

GPTSwift is a lightweight and convenient wrapper around the OpenAI API. It is completely written in Swift. Currently, only ChatGPT's API is supported.

Using GPTSwift is easy:

```swift
let gptSwift = ChatGPTSwift(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")
try await gptSwift.ask("What is the answer to life, the universe and everything in it?")

// Stream the answers as they are generated
var answer = ""
for try await nextWord in try await gptSwift.streamedAnswer.ask("Tell me a story about birds") {
    answer += nextWord
}
```

An example project can be found here: [GPTPlayground](https://github.com/SwiftedMind/GPTPlayground/tree/main)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

GPTSwift supports iOS 15+, macOS 12+, watchOS 8+ and tvOS 15+.

### Installation

The package is installed through the Swift Package Manager. Simply add the following line to your `Package.swift` dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftedMind/GPTSwift", from: "2.0.0")
```

Alternatively, if you want to add the package to an Xcode project, go to `File` > `Add Packages...` and enter the URL "https://github.com/SwiftedMind/GPTSwift" into the search field at the top. GPTSwift should appear in the list. Select it and click "Add Package" in the bottom right.

## Usage

GPTSwift is just a lightweight wrapper around the API. Here are a few examples:

```swift
import GPTSwift

func askChatGPT() async throws {
    let gptSwift = ChatGPTSwift(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")

    // Basic query
    let firstResponse = try await gptSwift.ask("What is the answer to life, the universe and everything in it?")
    print(firstResponse.choices.map(\.message))

    // Send multiple messages
    let secondResponse = try await gptSwift.ask(
        messages: [
            ChatMessage(role: .system, content: "You are a dog."),
            ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "Do you actually like playing fetch?")
        ]
    )
    print(secondResponse.choices.map(\.message))

    // Full control
    var fullRequest = ChatRequest(
        messages: [
            .init(role: .system, content: "You are the pilot of an alien UFO. Be creative."),
            .init(role: .user, content: "Where do you come from?")
        ]
    )
    fullRequest.temperature = 0.8
    fullRequest.numberOfAnswers = 2

    let thirdResponse = try await gptSwift.ask(with: fullRequest)
    print(thirdResponse.choices.map(\.message))
}
```

### Streaming answers

All of the above methods have a variant that lets you stream GPT's answer word for word, right as they are generated. The stream is provided to you via an `AsyncThrowingStream`. All you have to do is add a `streamedAnswer` before the call to `ask()`. For example:

```swift
import GPTSwift

// In your view model
@Published var gptAnswer = ""

func askChatGPT() async throws {
    let gptSwift = ChatGPTSwift(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")

    // Basic query
    gptAnswer = ""
    for try await nextWord in try await gptSwift.streamedAnswer.ask("Tell me a story about birds") {
        gptAnswer += nextWord
    }
}
```
